<h3>Archives & Catalog Retrieval</h3>

The Archives & Catalog Retrieval dialog allows access to remote image and star
catalod services.

<p>
Use the menus in the top left to select a data source.


<p>
Pressing <b>Retrieve Data</b> in the upper right will start the query.

<p>
If the <b>Object</b> field is not blank the retrieval will try to convert the
object name to an RA and Dec before placing a query.

<p>
If an image is already loaded in to the JS9 frame, the <b>Set RA/Dec</b> button
will retrieve the field center and size from the image and fill in the dailog's
form fields.
